homework2 has a convolutional neural network for image classfication.  homework.train has the training code and homework.models has the convolutional model
homework3 has a fully convolution model(FCN) for semantic labelling task(classifier every pixel). homework.train_fcn has the training code and homework.models has the fcn model
homework4 has an FCN for point-based object detection. Specifically prediction of dense heatmap of object centers. homework.train has the training code and homework.models has the fcn model
A neural network and a rudimentary controller is used to drive kart in supertux kart. The FCN (homework.planner) predicts the middle of the road by looking at the video frames of the video game  and the controller uses this information in addition to other featuures to drive the kart (for demo: python3 -m homework5.homework.planner zengarden -v)
